<h1>Research</h1>
<p>
    My PhD research concerned semantics of imperfective
    (especially progressive) aspect, semantic change and computational
    modeling, and the syntax and semantics of concessive clauses
    (e.g., adverbial clauses headed by <i>even though</i> and <i>although</i>).
    I also worked on the semantics of complementizers
    and reportative constructions.
