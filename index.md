I'm a Visting Fellow in Linguistics at Harvard University. I defended my dissertation, titled "Pluractionality in Progress", in May 2021. Broadly, my research interests are semantics, pragmatics, and language change and how these things can be modeled computationally. Recently, I have been thinking about the semantics and diachrony of pluractionality and aspect, and the syntax and semantics of concessive clauses. You can read more about my research on the [Research page](/research.html). I am a former member of the [Meaning and Modality Lab](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/meaningandmodality/home) at Harvard Linguistics.

Prior to the PhD, I graduated from Boston College with a BA in Linguistics and Philosophy, where I completed a thesis examining the metaphysics of normativity and the context-sensitivity of normative statements. I am originally from Kansas City, Missouri. Beyond academics, you can find me listening, making, and DJing experimental music or watching Kansas City Royals baseball.
