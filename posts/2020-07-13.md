This is a new design for the site, built using [Hakyll](http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll) instead of my usual method of just typing out all the pages individually and triple checking to make sure they're all uniform as if it's 1998.

This also allows me to have a blog. I'm not sure if I'll use this yet, or how I'll use it if I do, but I'm keeping the option open. Until next time~
