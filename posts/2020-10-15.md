Now that the pandemic has forced everything online, even playing records alone in a dark room, I'm able to (remotely) DJ again at [WZBC](wzbc.org).

[Sights and Sounds of NASCAR](https://spinitron.com/WZBC/show/212519/Sights-and-Sounds-of-NASCAR) features noise and experimental sounds every Sunday morning/Saturday night 1-2am.

Eventually, I'll upload shows somewhere. In the meantime, enjoy [this promo](https://soundcloud.com/nickbenevenia/the-sights-and-sounds-of-nascar) my friend cut for a previous iteration of this show.
